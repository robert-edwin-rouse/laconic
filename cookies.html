        <p>
            This cookie policy (Policy) describes what cookies are and how they're 
            being used by the laconicmate.com website ("Website; or Service") and 
            any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services"). 
            This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" 
            or "your") and Laconic Drinks Limited (doing business as "Laconic", 
            "we", "us" or "our"). If you are entering into this Policy on behalf 
            of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the 
            authority to bind such entity to this Policy, in which case the terms 
            "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have 
            such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, 
            you must not accept this Policy and may not access and use the Website 
            and Services. You should read this Policy so you can understand the 
            types of cookies we use, the information we collect using cookies and 
            how that information is used. It also describes the choices available 
            to you regarding accepting or declining the use of cookies. For 
            further information on how we use, store and keep your personal data 
            secure, see our privacy policy.

        <h2><br/>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved 
            on your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a 
            browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, 
            either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple 
            repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). Session cookies are 
            temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the 
            Website, and they expire when you close the web browser.
            <br />Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within 
            our Website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you 
            close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent 
            and efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.
            <br/>Cookies may be set by the Website ("first-party cookies"), or by 
            third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising

            third parties can recognize you when you visit our website and also
