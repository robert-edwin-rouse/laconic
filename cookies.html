            such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, 
            you must not accept this Policy and may not access and use the Website

            browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, 
            either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple 
            repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie").
            <br />Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the 
            course of your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close 
            the web browser.
            <br />Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within 
            our Website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you

            and efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.
            <br/>Cookies may be set by the Website ("first-party cookies"), or by

            or analytics services on the Website ("third party cookies"). These 
            third parties can recognize you when you visit our website and also 
            when you visit certain other websites.
